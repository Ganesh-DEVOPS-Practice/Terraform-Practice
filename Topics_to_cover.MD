Good question! Here's why we use DynamoDB for state locking in Terraform instead of storing the state file directly in DynamoDB:

1. Prevents Concurrent State Modifications (Locking)
Issue: If multiple users run terraform apply at the same time, it can corrupt the state file.
Solution: DynamoDB prevents concurrent operations by locking the state file. Only one Terraform process can modify the state at a time.

2. Terraform State File is Large
Issue: Terraform state files contain details of all resources, dependencies, and metadata, which can be large and frequently updated.
Solution: S3 is optimized for storing large objects, whereas DynamoDB is designed for structured, small key-value data.\

3. S3 + DynamoDB = Best Practice
S3 handles state storage: Terraform state files are stored in S3, providing versioning, durability, and cost-effectiveness.
DynamoDB handles locking: It only stores a small lock record, preventing race conditions.

4. Cost Efficiency
S3 is cheaper for storing large state files.
DynamoDB (with minimal RCU/WCU) is cost-effective for state locking.
Storing state in DynamoDB would be expensive because DynamoDB charges per read/write operation, and the entire state file would need multiple operations.

5. Performance & Scalability
S3 is optimized for storing large objects and provides faster retrieval.
DynamoDB is optimized for fast, small operations, making it ideal for locking.

Conclusion
✅ Use S3 for state storage (cheaper, durable, versioned).
✅ Use DynamoDB for state locking (prevents concurrency issues).
❌ Don't store state in DynamoDB (expensive, inefficient, not designed for large files).
